      <p>University of Calgary students are working on building a social network component for Pachira Social Enterprise – an organization that strives to empower giving and hopes to inspire generosity.</p><br>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">Calgary, AB, October 2020</span> - As part of the University of Calgary’s CPSC 594 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT, Pachira Social Enterprise was selected as one of the industry collaboration partners. Under the guidance of Dr. Guenther Ruhe, University of Calgary students will lend their skills and their software engineering knowledge to real-world applications for a smoother transition into the workplace.</p><br>
      <p>The project is to create a social network for Pachira’s user portal. The component will be a space where Pachira users can connect, engage and communicate with one another, share their own stories of kindness, and encourage acts of social impact with other subscribers. “By creating this social network component, we hope to inspire and bring together a new generation of change makers,” said Jade O’Hearn, Founder and CEO of Pachira Social Enterprise. “We are very excited by this collaboration. Pachira is an avid supporter of student development and learning.”</p><br>
      <p>Pachira provides students with the opportunity to utilize the skills they acquire from their post-secondary education in a real-world context to gain professional experience and propel them forward within their careers.

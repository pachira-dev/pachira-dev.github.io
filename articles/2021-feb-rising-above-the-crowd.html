    <p>What does it take to get an internship in a world that has turned topsy-turvy? Unemployment is at an all-time high, companies and businesses closing, layoffs looming, and competition is fierce. Pachira’s last internship posting (Feb. 2021), we received over 3,000 views and over 900 applications.</p>

    <p>We don’t mean to brag, but we are so proud that in less than one year, we have supported 18 students across Canada with work integrated learning opportunities, so we've seen a "few" resumes in our time.</p>

      <p>1. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Same old, same old means the same as everyone else. </span>Especially “creative positions”, such as, social media, marketing, and journalism; traditional resumes don’t work well. Showcase your creativity in the layout or design of your resume and cover letter. Don’t be shy about using colours and unique designs to make your documents be a reflection of your creative-self.</p><br />
      <p>2. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Show ‘n Tell. </span>Use a free website to compile all your previous work (completed for clients or samples of “for fun” designs, posts, blog/writings, etc. ), and include link to that website in your resume &/or cover: Be sure to protect your client’s confidentiality or get their permission to publish.</p><br />
      <p>3. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">The Experience Dilemma. </span>How do you get experience, with no experience? Use technology and software to your advantage. Use sections of your resumes to create an engaging website, and highlight your school projects, volunteer, athletic achievements (show your dedication, team spirit and leadership). Yes, include pictures of yourself in “action” or in a professional setting.</p><br />
      <p>4. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Give to get back. </span>Are you already working on a social cause, invention, or an innovative problem? If so, share your brilliance! (Not the secret "sauce", just the idea). Give a sample gift, write an article or blog for any employer you would like to connect with. If they use your sample or gift, include that in your portfolio. You can be sure that when they're hiring, you will be top of mind.</p><br />
      <p>5. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Presenting the professional and authentic “YOU” </span>Please only include your professional sites: LinkedIn or your professional website. Be authentic.</p><br />
      <p>6. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Research, research, research. </span>Show you care about the company. Discover their mission, vision, values, culture and make sure those align with your personal values, ideologies and outlook. After all, it’s got to be the best fit for both.</p><br />
      <p>7. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Etiquette networking. </span>Follow the company’s social media accounts, and engage: say “hi” and tell them a bit about what drew you to the company. Don’t try to “sell”, instead comment on some of their posts, blogs/articles. Be respectful, courteous and professional.</p><br />
      <p>8. &nbsp;<span class="font-semibold">Take the Pachira "Pitch Your Cause" Internship Challenge. </span>We don't even look at resumes.

              Only two sleeps to go now! In preparing for my trip, I have been consulting various 
              packing lists for Madagascar that people have shared on the web. Of course, these can vary widely 
              depending on what they are going to Madagascar for. Since these were of great aid to me, I thought 
              I would share my packing list in case someone else facing a similar upcoming trip might find it 
              useful or if you’ve asked me out of curiosity and I’ve replied with – what am I NOT packing.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              (For a full packing list:

            I used multiple packing cubes to help me stay organized, and divided all my things with extra 
            consideration to make sure that I have all the essentials in the unfortunate case my checked 
            bag goes missing. (read: my carry on is packed FULL with mainly my tent, a few changes of clothing, 
            socks, underwear, medications and some toiletries). I’m also borrowing my brother’s travel cover 
            to help protect my duffel’s inevitable tossed-around journey and offer rain protection for it.

          <p>One more thing! Last but not least, an open-mind and sense of humour. Because as I’m writing this and stressing over if I’m underpacked or more likely (very) overpacked – sometimes you just got to go with the flow and laugh about the inevitable mishaps. If you know me at all, I’m ridiculously clumsy and often scatter- brained. And the crazy things that happen when  traveling are often the most memorable and hilarious to look back on (remember that time  I  got food poisoning while on an 8 hour bumpy ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara and our bus collided with a taxi…. horrid at the time, hilarious now).</p>

            I will be on my way to Madagascar in less than ten days now!! If you have talked to me at all about 
            it, I have definitely been a broken record on repeat. I am excited. I am nervous. And I’ve created 
            a bit of a packing whirlwind in collecting all the things I plan to take with me for my three months 
            in Madagascar.

          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="text-red-600">Who am I going with?</span> I am going with the Madagascar Biodiversity 
            Project. Together, OHDZA-MBP works with the local Malgasy community across Madagascar to run 
            conservation projects aimed at solving some of Madagascar’s toughest challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="text-red-600">Where am I going?</span> The Commune of Kianjavato, a collection of a 
            dozen or so villages in southeast Madagascar. I will be staying and working out of the Kianjavato 
            Ahmanson Field Station (KAFS), which is surrounded by fragmented forests home to wildlife that 
            include nine lemur species.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="text-red-600">What am I doing?</span> We will be supporting two main projects of 
            the NGO – lemur monitoring and reforestation. Two species of critically endangered lemur are 
            monitored at KAFS – the greater bamboo lemur. On the reforestation side, we will be working with 
            locals to care for seedling nursuries and plant trees to help reconnect the fragmented mountainous 
            landscape, while engaging the community.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">
            <span class="text-red-600">Why am I going?</span> I wanted the rare opportunity to contribute 
            to meaningful conservation efforts and experience a country I only dreamed of visiting before. 
            I am especially eager to work with MBP because I believe their investment in the local community 
            has a transformative power to encourage long-term sustainability. Aside from being acquainted 
            with the local lemurs, I am very much looking forward to experiencing all the biodiversity and 
            culture that Madagascar and its people have to offer. And that’s it for now! Thanks for coming along 
            with me on what I hope will be an incredible, wild adventure.

          Akoryabe! Or “hello, how are you” as the locals here in Kianjavato say. My guide says the answer 
          is always “tsara be”. Very well. No matter how you are feeling, that is the answer and I think also 
          a great mindset to adapt. It’s been one week since we left Tana for Kianjavato and it feels like 
          so much has happened.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          On our first day at KAFS, I woke up at 5am to roosters, with the first rays of sunrise lighting up 
          my tent. The view from the hut Sydney and I are sharing is STUNNING. The sun begins to crest over a 
          nearby mountain and light streams through the huge leaves of the ravenala traveller’s palm. We are 
          surrounded by lush greenery. I’m so excited to get to wake up to this view everyday. As it’s Sunday, 
          we mostly relax and get more settled. Later in the day we celebrated International Reforestation Day 
          and planted our first seedlings here – and at the same time, saw our first snake and experienced our 
          first big rain!
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          The next day, we briefly met our guides for the first time as well as many other MBP staff. After 
          this quick introduction, Fredo took us on a  tour of the little villages  dotting the single road in 
          the area. We met many of the locals we’ll get to know     over the next three months here, toured some 
          schools where the children excitedly giggled and greeted us with “Salama vazaha” or “hello foreigner” 
          and even took  some pictures with the Mayor after he kindly welcomed us to Kianjavato. The walk was 
          very hot (mafanabe) but I was also distracted by the abundance of fruit trees – jackfruit, avocado, 
          lime and more.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          Upon our return to KAFS, we had lunch and then broke apart into our project groups. Daniel and I are on 
          Team Varecia (the black and white ruffed lemur) for our first project, and we began some training with 
          the Varecia supervisor, Cressant.The rest of the week has been a blur. It was so exciting seeing Varecia 
          for the first time. Their alarms are loud and can be heard long before we reach them, and when we do – they 
          look adorable with their fluffy black and white faces peeking down at us.  We have already visited all 
          three of our sites for Varecia monitoring this week and even held our first professional development day 
          yesterday (where Daniel and I teach English to our guides every other Friday). More on all of this later 
          as I feel like there’s so much to say.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-2">
          I am learning and experiencing so much and there’s so much I want to share!

          I celebrated my birthday last week with my camp family. They surprised me with cake and pizza, in addition 
          to the pasta dinner we were having that night. It was such a lovely and unexpected surprise, considering the 
          lack of modern kitchen tools and cake ingredients out here. (Edited for length)
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Ranomafana felt like a true holiday destination. We stayed at Chez Caspar, which provided us cozy rustic 
          cabin-like bungalows surrounded by a garden, and a hotel lobby overlooking the village.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          After settling in and purchasing our park entries, we headed on a hike into the park with our guide Patrick. 
          Here we walked winding trails through the rainforest offering peeks at numerous tiny critters that included 
          insects, frogs, geckos and chameleons. To my lemur count (of the three I’ve seen in Kianjavato – the black 
          and white ruffed, greater bamboo and red-fronted), we added sightings of the golden bamboo and red-bellied 
          lemur, as well as the Milnes-Edward sifaka. It is so exciting to watch these animals in their natural habitat, 
          and I feel so lucky to be able to see all these endemic and endangered species. Besides this, the highlight 
          of the hike was being able to swim at a beautiful waterfall. The cold water allowed me to feel the most 
          refreshed I’ve been this trip and though we came out having to detach numerous leaches (!!!), it was definitely 
          worth it to not feel sweaty for once. I have to point out that while it is  still and always disgusting, I am 
          slightly desensitized to leaches here as it isn’t uncommon to find one on myself or one of my guides after one 
          of our long days doing follows in the rainforests.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Beyond our long and sometimes gruelling days of fieldwork, settling into the area and being able to recognize 
          and say hello to familiar faces in the village has been really nice.

            It’s been over three weeks monitoring black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) in the rainforest so far. 
            They are of critically endangered status, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to work with MBP and be a part of 
            conservation research aimed at preserving their populations in this area.

            In three different field sites (Sangasanga, Tsitola and Vatovavy) we join guides who spend the day tracking small 
            populations of Varecia. We usually hike in, pull out the ATS to track collared individuals, and after finding them
             – go wherever they go. We get to relax a bit when they’re sprawled out napping, sunbathing, or feeding upside down 
             on a branch, but other times we are chasing them up and down mountainous forests as they effortlessly leap through 
             high in the canopy. Tsitola and Vatovavy in particular have rather dense forests, and sometimes it feels like I’m 
             hostage to a tangle of vines, bushes and branches as I try to jump, run and climb through. I’ve grabbed spikey 
             trees, slid down steep muddy hills, bushwacked through countless webs, and been bitten and stung  by a variety of 
             insects – all while trying to keep up with our guides. They say we are strong but still slow, and this only motivates 
             me to keep up with them more and be as strong as they are – even when they say to take it mora mora (slowly, slowly). 
             They are incredibly good at tracking the lemurs and are so knowledgeable about the flora and fauna and forest area. 
             In between our observations, I try to encourage my guides to learn English through conversation and games, and 
             they’ll also teach me Malagasy. We share half-understood stories and snacks, and at Sangasanga – the occasional fresh 
             ampalybe (jackfruit, one of my faves!).

              One of the things I love about Madagascar is how widely celebrated Women’s Day is. It is a larger celebration than 
              I have experienced anywhere else, with people all over Madagascar taking part in loud, joyous celebration.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 font-semibold">Women’s Day Planting Event</p>
            <p>
              Leading up to Women’s Day, our team split up and each of us joined different communities for volunteer planting events 
              in their local area to celebrate International Women’s Day. I got to join  the village of Ambolotara – which was the 
              village where some of my Varecia guides from our Vatovavy site belonged to. It was nice to work with their familiar 
              faces and get to know some of the women  of their village. At the end of the day, with sixteen Women’s Associations 
              totaling about 700 women, we planted over 21 thousand trees – the most trees planted by MBP in one day to date!!
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 font-semibold">Celebration!</p>
            <p>
              When Women’s Day finally arrived it was yet another day of continuous pouring rain. But living through the hot and 
              rainy season, you really learn to not let that deter you. We walked to Ambalahosy early in the morning to hang out 
              with our friends and get ready for the day’s celebrations. They helped us pin our lambas, which this year were of 
              vibrant orange and red, paired with a pink shirt with neon green lettering “Za! Mijoro!” (which translates to 
              something like stand/rise up!).
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              It felt like we were celebrating diversity and unity all at once. Each group then went on to showcase their moves 
              to their own choice of song. I loved that the women of Ambalohosy had chosen a more traditional dance this year, 
              and the crowd certainly loved seeing us volunteers embrace it. We were absolutely soaked by the end, but it was so 
              much fun cheering each other on and truly – dancing in the rain!
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              It will surely be a memory I’ll cherish.

          I have officially been home in Calgary for one week after an unexpected whirlwind ending to my Madagascar adventure due 
          to the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ll admit, I was putting off blogging because I  was tired and sad and *momentarily* 
          struggling a bit with all that is going on. It almost doesn’t feel real that one Monday we were coming off a wonderful 
          weekend trip to Fianaratsoa and preparing to enjoy our last three weeks in Madagascar and within a few hectic days, 
          we were all home and in self-isolation.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The process of evacuating was very abrupt. On Monday, March 16th, my team at Vatovavy and I were making our way out of 
          the forest after a fun day laughing together during six hours of lemur follows. On our way down, we received a phone 
          call that we were to go back to camp, pack up our jungle home, and head back to the capital early next morning to 
          evacuate the country as soon as possible, with Madagascar deciding to close its borders on March 19th. While our time 
          in Madagascar was soon coming to an end anyway, I don’t think any of us were mentally prepared to leave so hastily and 
          say goodbye to the family we made there (or with many – not have the chance to say goodbye to). As much as we could and 
          in between many tears (okay, maybe it was mostly just me, being a sentimental sap….) we spent the night celebrating the 
          time we shared together and partying with our Malagasy family. I feel very grateful to have had as much time as we did, 
          and to have had such an amazing experience that it was so hard to leave.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Getting home was a huge struggle that involved living in airports for four days and dealing with numerous flight 
          cancellations and changes but I am so, so grateful that I could make it back. A huge thank you to my family, friends 
          and the people at MBP who supported me throughout it and helped me get home safely. I am especially appreciative of my 
          parents and acknowledge that they had to put up with probably countless lost hours of sleep worrying and stressing over 
          my return!
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          It’s a weird time in the world with these unexpected changes and times of uncertainty. I met some rad Peace Corp volunteer 
          friends – who made a life in Madagascar in the months to years they’ve spent there and I am thinking of all of them as they 
          deal with reverse culture shock and whatever mix of emotions they are experiencing. I am thinking of Madagascar and hoping 
          that despite the obvious financial difference the lack of tourism will have, that its people are able to access the basic 
          necessities and stay healthy and happy.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Amidst the whirlwind that has been my Madagascar adventure, COVID-19, and coming home to my family and friends – I am 
          reminded of how much we are all connected. Love and kindness truly do make the world go round. 
          <span class="font-semibold italic">Veloma Madagascar - for now.</span>

        <p class="mt-3 text-center font-semibold">Stay happy and healthy everyone!</p>
